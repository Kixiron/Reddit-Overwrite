# Reddit-Overwrite

Overwrites reddit comments using Selenium.

To install Selenium, follow this [handy guide](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html)  
When running this, you'll get lots of handy little automoderator messages in roughly this format:

```txt
Greetings, /u/USERNAME! Your comment has been automatically removed because it is spam. Spamming is a really shitty thing to do. This script is dumb and pointless. You actually aren't even protecting any privacy because there are many sites out there that specifically cache comments just so that users cannot edit them.

To reiterate, this script is terrible and you should not be using it. Search for a different one, or edit it to say something less spammy. But in the end, it won't matter because we can still see whatever it was that you edited.

You should also read this: https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204536499-What-constitutes-spam-Am-I-a-spammer-

Did I mention that is spammy and we don't like it?

I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.
```

As far as I can tell, these do nothing.

Disclaimer: Any and all potential consequences from running this script are 100% yours.
